What you did well:
- Your report is very thorough.
- Nice benchmarking. We appreciate the plots and that rather than just plotting total time as a function of input size, you also plotted time spent on different code sections via hotspot analysis. This was quite illuminating.
- Good job analyzing different ways of distributing information across processes without shared memory. Expected speedup analysis was a nice inclusion.
- Nice performance plots for your MPI implementation and discussion / future directions.

Suggestions for improvement:
- The math notation in your report is a little sloppy. It would have been nice if you spent more time introducing the notion of a tropical matrix multiplication for unfamiliar readers.
- A simple direction to consider would be to avoid copying the entire matrix onto each processor using a different blocking scheme.

Misc comments:
- LaTeX is where itâ€™s at.
